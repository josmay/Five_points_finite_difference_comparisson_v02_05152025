## Requirements

The code was developed and tested using:

- Python ≥ 3.9
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for reproducing figures)

---

## Reproducibility

All numerical experiments shown in the paper that involve:

- derivative accuracy comparisons
- forward model validation
- stability assessments

can be reproduced using the scripts in the `examples/` directory.

Numerical parameters (grid spacing, time step, domain size) are chosen consistently with the values reported in the manuscript.

## Relation to the Article

This repository corresponds to the **supplementary numerical material** referenced in:

- Section *[X]*: Numerical Scheme
- Section *[Y]*: Forward Model
- Appendix *[Z]* (if applicable)

The five-point operator implemented here is the same operator denoted by  
\( \boldsymbol{D}_5 \) in the paper.
